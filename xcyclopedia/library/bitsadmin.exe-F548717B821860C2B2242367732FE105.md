BITSADMIN version 3.0
BITS administration utility.
(C) Copyright 2000-2006 Microsoft Corp.

BITSAdmin is deprecated and is not guaranteed to be available in future versions of Windows.
Administrative tools for the BITS service are now provided by BITS PowerShell cmdlets.

Invalid command
USAGE: BITSADMIN [/RAWRETURN] [/WRAP | /NOWRAP] command
The following commands are available:

/HELP           Prints this help 
/?              Prints this help 
/UTIL /?        Prints the list of utilities commands 
/PEERCACHING /?   Prints the list of commands to manage Peercaching
/CACHE /?       Prints the list of cache management commands 
/PEERS /?       Prints the list of peer management commands

/LIST    [/ALLUSERS] [/VERBOSE]     List the jobs
/MONITOR [/ALLUSERS] [/REFRESH sec] Monitors the copy manager
/RESET   [/ALLUSERS]                Deletes all jobs in the manager

/TRANSFER <job name> [type] [/PRIORITY priority] [/ACLFLAGS flags] 
          remote_url local_name
    Transfers one of more files.
    [type] may be /DOWNLOAD or /UPLOAD; default is download
    Multiple URL/file pairs may be specified.
    Unlike most commands, <job name> may only be a name and not a GUID.

/CREATE [type] <job name>               Creates a job
    [type] may be /DOWNLOAD, /UPLOAD, or /UPLOAD-REPLY; default is download
    Unlike most commands, <job name> may only be a name and not a GUID.

/INFO <job> [/VERBOSE]                   Displays information about the job
/ADDFILE <job> <remote_url> <local_name> Adds a file to the job
/ADDFILESET <job> <textfile>             Adds multiple files to the job
   Each line of <textfile> lists a file's remote name and local name, separated
   by spaces.  A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment.
   Once the file set is read into memory, the contents are added to the job.

/ADDFILEWITHRANGES  <job> <remote_url> <local_name range_list>
   Like /ADDFILE, but BITS will read only selected byte ranges of the URL.
   range_list is a comma-delimited series of offset and length pairs.
   For example,

       0:100,2000:100,5000:eof

   instructs BITS to read 100 bytes starting at offset zero, 100 bytes starting
   at offset 2000, and the remainder of the URL starting at offset 5000.

/REPLACEREMOTEPREFIX <job> <old_prefix> <new_prefix>
    All files whose URL begins with <old_prefix> are changed to use <new_prefix>

Note that BITS currently supports HTTP/HTTPS downloads and uploads.
It also supports UNC paths and file:// paths as URLS

The following options control peercaching of a particular job:

/SETPEERCACHINGFLAGS  <job> <value>   
    Sets the flags for the job's peercaching behavior.
    The value is an unsigned integer with the following interpretation for the bits in the binary representation.
        Allow the job's data to be downloaded from a peer : Set the least significant bit
        Allow the job's data to be served to peers        : Set the 2nd bit from right

/GETPEERCACHINGFLAGS  <job>               
    Reports the flags for the job's peercaching behavior.

The following options are valid for UPLOAD-REPLY jobs only:

/GETREPLYFILENAME <job>        Gets the path of the file containing the server reply
/SETREPLYFILENAME <job> <path> Sets the path of the file containing the server reply
/GETREPLYPROGRESS <job>        Gets the size and progress of the server reply
/GETREPLYDATA     <job>        Dumps the server's reply data in hex format

The following options can be placed before the command:
/RAWRETURN                     Return data more suitable for parsing
/WRAP                          Wrap output around console (default)
/NOWRAP                        Don't wrap output around console

The /RAWRETURN option strips new line characters and formatting.
It is recognized by the /CREATE and /GET* commands.

Commands that take a <job> parameter will accept either a job name or a job ID
GUID inside braces.  BITSADMIN reports an error if a name is ambiguous.
